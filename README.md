## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

## What is Death Swap?

Death Swap is a mini-game where after 5 minutes every player teleports to someone else. The goal is to kill someone after a teleportation.

## How to use it

- select players to your game using `/deathswap add` command
- type `/deathswap start` to start the match!

## Commands
